# Data Classification

The following table presents an overview of sensitive data types handled by the system. P1 is designated for highly sensitive data, P2 for sensitive data, and P3 for all other business critical data. This classification system helps prioritize the protection of different types of data based on their sensitivity and criticality.

Understanding and categorizing the types of sensitive data is crucial for maintaining data security and compliance with relevant regulations. By clearly defining the nature of the data handled by the system, appropriate safeguards and controls to protect the confidentiality and integrity of this information can be established. Furthermore, a privacy policy can be developed.

Also, it may lead to targeted identity theft efforts.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>P2</td><td>Social</td><td>Connections, usual exchanges between accounts and similar activities among public wallet addresses and their analysis.
